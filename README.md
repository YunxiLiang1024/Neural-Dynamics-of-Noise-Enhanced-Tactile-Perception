# Neural-Dynamics-of-Noise-Enhanced-Tactile-Perception
Aging often leads to reduced tactile sensory function, impairing balance and mobility. Subsensory electrical noise stimulation (SENS) has shown promise as a therapeutic intervention to enhance tactile perception, as evidenced by studies like Breen et al. [Docs Contribution Guide](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2016.05.015)! on healthy adults. This study investigates the efficacy of SENS in older adults with sensory deficits and explores its potential to improve balance and overall well-being.
Two key mechanisms underlie the effects of SENS: stochastic resonance and neural network synchronization. Stochastic resonance optimizes weak sensory signal processing through added noise, enhancing sensitivity at the receptor level. However, its influence is likely limited to localized sensory end organs. Neural synchronization, on the other hand, involves improved timing and coordination among co-activated neurons. Computational models show that uncorrelated noise increases synchronization across networks, improving sensory processing and integration.
Using computational modeling, this study simulates two coupled neural networks with varying connectivity patterns (excitatory, inhibitory, or both) and noise levels. Results show that excitatory coupling promotes synchronization under high noise differences, while inhibitory coupling stabilizes synchronization across noise conditions. Combined coupling, however, diminishes synchronization at higher connectivity strengths. These findings suggest that noise-induced synchronization enhances sensory function, offering insights into therapeutic applications and broader neural mechanisms underlying perception and cognition.
